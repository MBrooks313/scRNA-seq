# scRNA-seq
Single cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline.

This repo contains scripts for processing kallisto-bustools output to Seurat object. DecontX and DoubletFinder are used to remove ambiant RNA contamiination and automated detection of heterotypic doublets. SCT v2 is used for normalization and scType is used for cell type annotation.
